# FASDD Stage 1: Pre-training with multi-class detection
# SAI-Net Two-Stage Workflow - Stage 1 Configuration

# FASDD Dataset Only - Multi-class (fire + smoke)
train: data/yolo/images/train
val: data/yolo/images/val

# Multi-class configuration (maintain original FASDD classes)
nc: 2                    # Two classes: fire and smoke
names: ['fire', 'smoke'] # Original FASDD class names

# Optional test set
test: data/yolo/images/test

# Dataset statistics for Stage 1
# FASDD: ~95,314 images with fire and smoke bounding boxes
# Objective: Learn diverse fire/smoke detection with rich variety
# Expected output: Multi-class detector with good generalization
