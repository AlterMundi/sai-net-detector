# FASDD Stage 1: Pre-training (Multi-class as per training plan)
# SAI-Net Two-Stage Workflow - Stage 1 Configuration

# FASDD Dataset - Multi-class fire and smoke detection
train: data/yolo/images/train
val: data/yolo/images/val

# Multi-class configuration (keep original fire + smoke classes)
nc: 2                    # Two classes: fire and smoke
names: ['fire', 'smoke'] # Original FASDD class names

# Optional test set
test: data/yolo/images/test

# Dataset statistics for Stage 1
# FASDD: ~95,314 images (73,297 fire + 53,080 smoke objects)
# Multi-class training for diverse pattern learning
# Objective: Learn diverse fire/smoke detection with rich variety
# Expected output: Multi-class detector with good generalization
